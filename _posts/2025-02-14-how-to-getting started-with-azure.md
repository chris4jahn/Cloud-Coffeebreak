When I start a project in Azure there are x mandatory steps I always follow. 

With this blog series I want to dive into each of these topics and show you how to automate every step by using Infrastructure as Code (IaC). I prioritize using terraform, could be that I also use Azure CLI or PowerShell.

- Understand the Cloud Adoption Framework
  - Begin by exploring the Cloud Adoption Framework. This framework provides comprehensive documentation, best practices, and guidance to prepare for cloud migration. It’s crucial for reviewing and optimizing existing Azure environments to enhance management and security.
- Leverage the Well-Architected Framework
  - Incorporate the Well-Architected Framework, which offers technical guidance to harden, optimize, and secure your Azure environment. Integrated directly into Azure, this framework aids in improving cost posture, security, reliability, operational excellence, and performance.
- Strategic Planning — Microsoft Assessments
  - Start with strategic planning by assessing your business motivations and impacts of moving to the cloud. Determine the need for cost control, flexibility, or upgrading outdated data centers. Understanding these factors will guide your migration strategy.
- Comprehensive Assessment and Planning
  - Inventory existing servers, databases, and apps to understand which workloads are best suited for Azure. This step involves evaluating your environment’s readiness, including governance, compliance, security guidelines, and preparing the Landing Zone for migration.
- Manage and Optimize Post Migration — Azure Advisor
  - Post-migration, it’s important to manage and optimize your Azure environment. Use tools like Azure Advisor to continually assess the performance and security of your cloud setup. Regular reviews and adjustments will ensure that your migration remains effective and secure.
