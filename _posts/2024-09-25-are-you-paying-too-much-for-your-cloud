I bet you are paying too much for your cloud services. Why I think I know that? Because I guess everyone does. The only person that is not paying too much, is the person not using cloud services. What do you think?

## How to getting started with cost optimization
When you are at the beginning of your cloud optimization journey you are good not do everything at the same time, but to start in small steps. 
cost optimization does not necessarily mean to decrease costs. If your business outcome is growing, increasing cloud bills can be a result.

## Take these 8 steps for your cloud optimization in Azure
1. The first and most important step is to getting to know your costs. Start using the Azure Cost Management and dive into your costs over the last months or years. Then use the tool to have a daily or at least weekly look. Monthly is not the best choice as months differ from each other. On the other hand after a month it could be already too late if anomalies like forgotten test deployments could quickly lead to a big surprise in the upcoming cloud bill. 
2. Create Budget Alerts. Begin with creating an overall budget for the upcoming week. Over time you can adjust the budgets so that you are beginning to get a feeling for a forecast of your cloud costs. From there you can start creating budgets for teams, applications and so on. 
3. Create Anomaly Alerts. These alerts will help you finding services that lead to unusual cost increases. Having them in place will warn you and your teams to having a look at spikes coming from test environments that have been deoloyed and forgotten etc. Anomalies will lead to false positives but you should stay alert and not ignore them as they could prevent you from having exploding bills.
4. Identify cloud waste. Over time there are more and more services in your environment and it can quickly get confusing. Sometimes after testing services they are not deprovisioed or for example during deleting a VM their discs could be left. You can use Azure Advisor for helping you with that. But this will not identify all your unused resources.
5. Rightsize your resources. Often resources are deployed thinking the usage will be much higher or less than it turns out in relaity. That's why you should monitor your resources constantly and adjust the SKU as needed. Azure Advisor and Azure Monitor can find over- or underutilized resources.
6. Turn services off if they are not used. A lot of services are not needed over night. So why not turning them off. In classic environments it does not make big differences if a VM is running or not. But in the cloud it makes big differences. Pay as you go means you only pay for what you are using.
7. Start small with commitments. There are several ways of making commitments. Reserved Instances, Saving Plans or buying licenses for the Hybrid Benefit. All of them can safe a lot of money if they are really needed. Talk to the product owners and ensure that services are running 24/7 for the upcoming time before purchasing any commitment based plans.
8. Create dashboards and make costs a performance metric for your teams. Involve tech, business and finance and give each of them only the relevant data. It does not help them if they have an overview of the total costs. But if they can see business outcome and costs alligned to each other they yould optimize cost per business outcome.

## Cost optimization is no one-stop-shop, it's a process
You do not optimize your costs once and then it is all done. It is an ongoing process. You are good to go with the steps above. Start over from the beginning and optimize every part in small steps. Over time this will make you better in every disciplin. Embrace cloud and use the flexibility and agility, scale up and down and get used to pay-as-you-go. 

## Conclusion
You could prevent paying too much for your cloud if you are following the steps above. Start your cost optimization in small steps and try out one thing after the other. Iterate over every step again and again for becoming the expert in the relevant areas. Take care not to doing too much at a time as this could overextend your organization. Happy Saving!
