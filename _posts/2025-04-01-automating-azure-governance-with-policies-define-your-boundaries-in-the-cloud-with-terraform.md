On prem organizations define their boundaries and they need to exist in the cloud as well. This starts with naming your resources, which we covered in the last blog post, and goes on with defining regions where resourcse are allowed to being deployed etc.

As I work in Azure already since 2013 I saw a lot of customers that just started in the cloud. After a certain time they realize that withour defined boundaries the cloud quickly gets chaotic and hard to manage. Of course you can try to enforce your boundaries with organizational measures, but in this case I definetely prefer the technical approach.

## Find the right balance between boundaries and flexibility

The cloud is meant to support your agility and make use of it's flexibility. If you tie the boundaries to tight you risk to loose this agility. Depending of the environment (e.g. Dev, Test, Prod) you can tighten or loosen the guardrails. Make sure the cloud does not become the second on prem datacenter as it is much more than that. It's a place for innovation. Don't bring your legacy processes into the cloud!
