When you want to start with Azure cost optimization the first thing you need to do is to open the black box. That means you have to step out of your comfort zone where you simply quick-checked your costs and go into the detail of your cloud bill.

## Open the black box and know your costs

Most Azure customers I know treat their cloud bill like a black box. They know the total cost of the past months and compare it to the amount to the actual month. If the amount kind of fits to the past months they tick it off and that's it. But they don't know the details of their costs. What are the biggest cost drivers? Which apps lead to what costs? Are there new services, ... 

If you don't know your costs, you cannot optimize them!

In the first place looking into the details seem overwhelming and confusing. Perhaps there are hundreds, or thousands of resources billed to you every month. To get a good overview you need a tool that supports you with that. This can be Azure Cost Management as a native tool within Azure, but you can also use external BI or FinOps tooling.

## Use Azure Cost Management to dive into costs

## Export your data for external tools

## Conclusion

To being able to start your optimization journey the first thing you need to do is get rid of that black box called cloud bill. You can use Azure Cost Management or an external tool to dig into your data, create relevant reports for yourself, your teams and management. Knowing your costs is the starting point for Azure cost optimization.
