One of the first things most people think about when it comes to **Azure cost optimization** is **reservations**. By committing to a specific plan, like a VM family for 1 or 3 years, you can receive significant discounts. However, this is just one form of commitment. To make the most of your cloud investments, it’s essential to understand the different types of commitments and how to use them effectively. Let’s explore the options and strategies to ensure you save money while maintaining flexibility.

## Why Should I Start Small with Commitments?

Starting small allows you to familiarize yourself with the process and avoid costly mistakes. Diving in without preparation can lead to missteps, as I’ve seen with some customers who committed to large sets of VMs in the wrong region. This not only resulted in prolonged discussions with Microsoft but also ended up being an expensive lesson. It’s always a good idea to consult with experienced professionals and thoroughly research the nature of your commitments before purchasing. Starting with smaller commitments helps you fine-tune your strategy and scale confidently.

## Types of Commitments

Azure offers several commitment options, each designed to suit different workloads and organizational needs. Understanding these options is key to optimizing your spending. Commitments should not be seen as a one-time purchase but rather as an ongoing strategy that evolves with your business.

### Azure Reserved Instances

Azure Reserved Instances (RI) are one of the most popular cost-saving tools. They allow you to prepay for virtual machines, databases, and other resources in exchange for significant discounts, sometimes up to 72%, compared to pay-as-you-go pricing. However, they come with certain limitations.

Reserved Instances are tied to specific regions and VM families, so careful planning is necessary to ensure they align with your deployment needs. Microsoft provides options for exchanging or canceling Reserved Instances if requirements change, but these come with restrictions, such as prorated refunds and limits on the number of changes allowed per year.

By sticking to a consistent VM family, you can maximize flexibility and reuse reservations as workloads evolve. Reserved Instances are ideal for workloads with predictable usage patterns, such as production environments or long-running applications.

### Azure Saving Plans

Azure Saving Plans (SP) provide a more flexible alternative to Reserved Instances. Instead of committing to specific resources, you commit to a fixed monetary amount for a certain period, typically 1 or 3 years.

This flexibility allows you to save across multiple resource types and regions, making it an excellent choice for businesses with diverse or changing workloads. While the discounts offered by Saving Plans are generally lower than those of Reserved Instances, they cover a broader range of Azure services, including virtual machines, app services, and container instances.

This makes SPs a versatile option for organizations that prioritize adaptability over maximum savings. But be careful! There is no cancelation option like with RIs.

### Azure Hybrid Benefit

The Azure Hybrid Benefit is not a traditional commitment but a licensing strategy that allows you to bring your existing on-premises licenses to Azure. This option is particularly advantageous for organizations with Software Assurance, enabling them to make use of their licenses in Azure at no extra cost.

Alternatively, you can purchase licenses specifically for use in Azure, which is significantly cheaper than using Azure’s subscription-based licensing model.

Microsoft estimates that leveraging Azure Hybrid Benefit can reduce costs by up to 85% for certain workloads, making it a critical tool for long-term savings. This approach is particularly well-suited for organizations transitioning from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud.

## Monitor the Usage of Your Commitments

After committing to a plan, it’s essential to continuously monitor its usage. Are you fully utilizing your RIs or SPs? If not, consider adjusting your workloads or scaling resources to maximize the benefits of your commitments.

For example, if a reserved resource reaches the end of its lifecycle, explore whether it can be repurposed for other workloads within the same VM family. Staying within a limited number of VM families ensures greater flexibility in utilizing existing reservations.

Additionally, make use of free cancellation or exchange options where available to optimize your commitments over time. Regular reviews and adjustments will help you align your commitments with your actual needs.

## Conclusion

Commitments are a powerful tool for reducing Azure costs, but they require careful planning and ongoing management to realize their full potential. By starting small, understanding the different types of commitments, and monitoring their usage, you can build a sustainable strategy that saves money while keeping your cloud environment flexible and responsive. Combine Reserved Instances, Saving Plans, and Azure Hybrid Benefit strategically to tailor a cost-optimization approach that aligns with your organization’s needs.

Happy Optimization!
