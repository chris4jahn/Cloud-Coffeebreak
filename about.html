<p>My name is <b>Christian Forjahn</b> and I'm a huge Azure-Fan since more than 10 years now. I started my Azure career with the light blue "Windows Azure" portal based on Azure Service Manager (ASM). Since Azure Resource Manager (ARM) the platform became much better especially regarding the possiblities to using Infrastructure as Code.</p>

<p>As a father, outdoor enthusiast and tech-fan I like spending time with my family in nature or sharing my knowledge with the community. I'm living in Freiburg im Breisgau in Germany next to the famous black forest</p>
<p>On my Blog "Cloud Coffeebreak" I write about different topics around Azure like IaC, governance, networking, hybrid cloud, cost management, security, etc. You can meet me on commmunity events and where I enjoy networking, being on stage or in webinars. Connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-forjahn/">LinkdedIn</a> where I'm constantly engaged. </p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the blog. Have fun and give me feedback if you like.</p>
